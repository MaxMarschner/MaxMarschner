## 👋 Hi, I'm Max! 

I'm a <b>researcher</b> and <b>data scientist</b> with an interdisciplinary background in <b>cognitive science</b> and <b>psychology</b>. 

In my academic research, I investigated the cognitive foundations of human social interaction by examining how people manage to coordinate and cooperate with each other to achieve shared goals.
Keeping with that spirit while transitioning from academia to "the real world", I am highly motivated to apply my analytical and technical skills to innovative projects that 
generate meaningful impact for the <b>public good</b>, foster <b>social cohesion</b>, and improve <b>coordination</b> and <b>cooperation</b> between <b>citizens</b>, <b>public institutions</b>, and <b>civil society</b>.   

I enjoy <b>complexity</b>, <b>interdisciplinary discourse</b>, and solving <b>challenging problems</b> with <b>advanced technical tools</b>. At my desk, you can find me reading papers, building custom software applications, 
wrangling large datasets, fitting statistical models, visualizing complex data patterns, and synthesizing data-driven insights for presentations, reports, and working papers.  

You can find a selection of code I developed as part of my research projects here on GitHub.
